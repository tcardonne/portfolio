`Symfony 4`, `React Native`, `AngularJS`, `Cordova`, `WordPress`

I joined the Efrei Paris' Junior Enterprise in 2017 as a developer. I've worked on multiple projects for external customers.
During these projects, I've learnt how to build cross-platform mobile applications using frameworks like React-Native and Cordova.

## PulseHeberg

`Symfony 3`, `AngularJS`, `System administration`, `Networking`

I helped to create a centralized management interface for the hosting provider [pulseheberg.com](https://pulseheberg.com).
This interface enables customers to manage their services (web hosting, emails, VPN) in a central place.
The web hosting solution was fully developped by our team : from the development of the API to the underlying infrastructure.
