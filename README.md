I helped to create a centralized management interface for the hosting provider [pulseheberg.com](https://pulseheberg.com).
This interface enables customers to manage their services (web hosting, emails, VPN) in a central place.
The web hosting solution was fully developped by our team : from the development of the API to the underlying infrastructure.
